## ACTIVITY TIMELINE

### 2:00 PM - 2:15 PM | ARRIVAL & AVATAR CREATION STATION (15 minutes)
- **Description:** As guests arrive, each child receives a printed "Avatar Creation Card" where they design their Roblox avatar with markers and stickers. They wear their card as a lanyard or nameplate. While waiting for all guests to arrive, children can decorate their avatar cards and show them off to friends. Host greets each guest with excitement, explaining the day's "quests."
- **Theme Connection:** In Roblox, creating an avatar is the first step. This mirrors the game experience and immediately immerses kids in the theme.
- **Why It's Fun:** Kids love expressing creativity, personalizing their experience, and the immediate sense of belonging to the "game world."
- **Materials Needed:** Pre-printed avatar card templates, markers (various colors), stickers (stars, hearts, gems), hole punch, lanyards or ribbon
- **Setup Notes:** Have a designated table with supplies. Templates should be simple (basic avatar outline to customize). Keep this activity engaging but quick so late arrivals don't feel rushed.

### 2:15 PM - 2:35 PM | OBSTACLE COURSE: "ESCAPE THE LAVA" (20 minutes)
- **Description:** Create a parkway obstacle course using park equipment (playground structures, picnic tables, benches). Design it so children navigate from start to finish without "touching the lava" (designated ground areas marked with red rope or chalk). Include 5-6 stations: balance beam walk, crawl under obstacles, jump over cones, weave through pylons, climb structure, and finish line sprint. Time each child or run all together. Award points to the fastest or best form.
- **Theme Connection:** Roblox games like "Escape the Lava Obby" are hugely popular. This replicates that intense, exciting challenge.
- **Why It's Fun:** High-energy activity, physical challenge, competitive element, dramatic theme (escaping lava!), and immediate achievement.
- **Materials Needed:** Red rope or chalk for "lava" zones, orange and red balloons or cones to mark areas, timing device (phone stopwatch), small prizes or tokens
- **Setup Notes:** Scout the park beforehand. Map out a safe, continuous path using natural features and equipment. Ensure adequate space and no hazards. Have adults station at key points for safety. Test the course difficulty before guests arrive.

### 2:35 PM - 2:50 PM | GAME STATION ROTATION 1: "ROBUX COLLECTOR" (15 minutes)
- **Description:** Set up a coin/treasure hunt game. Hide small golden coins (plastic coins or printed "Robux tokens") throughout a designated park area. Give each child a small bag and 5-7 minutes to collect as many as they can. Robux is the virtual currency in Roblox, so this ties perfectly to theme. Count coins with kids and reward top collectors with small prizes. Recount and redistribute coins so everyone can do it again if time allows.
- **Theme Connection:** Robux is central to Roblox gameplay. Kids are doing exactly what their avatars do in-game: collecting currency and rewards.
- **Why It's Fun:** Treasure hunt excitement, competitive collection, discovery element, and they keep their "Robux" as party favors.
- **Materials Needed:** 50-100 plastic gold coins or printed token cards, small mesh or paper bags (1 per child), small prizes for top collectors
- **Setup Notes:** Hide coins at varying heights and difficulty levels so all kids find something. Keep within sight/manageable area of the park. Consider wind if using lightweight tokens.

### 2:50 PM - 3:05 PM | SNACK & HYDRATION BREAK (15 minutes)
- **Description:** Gather everyone to a picnic area or designated spot. Serve themed snacks (see suggestions below). Have water bottles or juice boxes available. Use this as a natural cooldown before next activity. Chat with kids about their favorite Roblox games while eating.
- **Theme Connection:** Branded snacks with Roblox references add immersion.
- **Why It's Fun:** Kids need physical breaks. Social time builds friendships and keeps energy balanced.
- **Materials Needed:** Snacks (see options below), drinks, cups, napkins, trash bags, wet wipes
- **Setup Notes:** Pre-arrange snack table before party starts. Have trash bags ready to keep area clean. Check for food allergies beforehand.

**Snack Suggestions:**
- Goldfish crackers (Robux-colored!)
- "Lava potion" punch (red juice with dry ice effect)
- Pizza bagels or mini sandwiches
- Apple slices with caramel (or fruit)
- Fruit gummies
- Mini chocolate chip cookies

### 3:05 PM - 3:25 PM | GAME STATION ROTATION 2: "BUILDING CHALLENGE" (20 minutes)
- **Description:** Divide kids into 2-3 teams. Each team gets a supply of Legos, wooden blocks, or building materials and a challenge card (draw from a hat). Challenges might be: "Build the tallest tower," "Create a house," "Build a bridge," "Make a parkour course," etc. Teams have 10 minutes to build, then 5 minutes to present and judge. Award "Master Builder" medals/ribbons to each team. This can all happen seated on a large blanket or at picnic tables if available.
- **Theme Connection:** Roblox Studio is where players CREATE games and worlds. This mirrors the creative building aspect of Roblox.
- **Why It's Fun:** Teamwork, creativity, sense of accomplishment, and competitive showcase aspect. Kids love seeing what others created.
- **Materials Needed:** Legos (200+ pieces), wooden blocks, or recycled building materials (cardboard boxes, paper tubes), challenge cards (pre-made), medals/ribbons, picture-taking setup
- **Setup Notes:** Pre-sort building materials into team bags. Have a judge (parent or older sibling) ready with criteria (creativity, stability, theme fit). Take photos of finished builds for memories.

### 3:25 PM - 3:40 PM | GAME STATION ROTATION 3: "PARKOUR PUZZLE RELAY" (15 minutes)
- **Description:** Create a relay race where each team sends one member at a time through a parkour-style course (stairs, benches, climbing), completes a simple puzzle at the end (jigsaw or logic puzzle), and returns to tag the next teammate. The puzzle element reflects "Roblox Escape Room" style games. First team to complete all members and finish the puzzle wins.
- **Theme Connection:** Many Roblox games combine parkour movement with puzzle-solving challenges (Escape the Obby, Deathrun, etc.).
- **Why It's Fun:** Combines physical activity with mental challenge. Relay format increases excitement and teamwork. Fast-paced and action-packed.
- **Materials Needed:** Simple jigsaw puzzles (4-6 pieces each, one per team), small cones or rope to mark course, stopwatch
- **Setup Notes:** Use playground equipment and natural features. Make puzzles simple enough to complete in 2-3 minutes. Have staff monitor for safety at height/climbing areas.

### 3:40 PM - 4:00 PM | HYDRATION & REST (20 minutes)
- **Description:** Another water/snack break with a low-energy cooldown. Gather kids and play easy, low-movement games or activities like "Would You Rather: Roblox Edition" (themed questions about game preferences), or tell stories about awesome Roblox moments. Some kids may want to just sit and chat.
- **Theme Connection:** Themed questions and conversation keep the Roblox world alive even during downtime.
- **Why It's Fun:** Social bonding, recovery time before final push, mental engagement without physical exhaustion.
- **Materials Needed:** Water bottles, cups, optional snacks (fruit, crackers), list of fun "Would You Rather" questions
- **Setup Notes:** Prepare questions ahead of time. Sit in a casual circle. This is a good time to let parents know how much longer the party will run.

**Sample "Would You Rather" Roblox Edition:**
- Would you rather live in a Roblox mansion or a castle?
- Would you rather be able to fly or teleport?
- Would you rather play Adopt Me or Build a Boat?
- Would you rather have unlimited Robux or unlimited items?

### 4:00 PM - 4:25 PM | GRAND FINALE: "ROBLOX QUEST CHAMPIONSHIP" (25 minutes)
- **Description:** Host a timed relay/challenge race that combines elements from previous activities. Divide remaining time into 3 quick "quests" (similar to tasks in Roblox games):
  - **Quest 1 - "Speed Runner"** (7 min): Sprint through a marked path with obstacles, completing small challenges (throw bean bags at targets, balance walk, etc.)
  - **Quest 2 - "Treasure Hunter"** (7 min): Hidden item scavenger hunt with Roblox-themed items (golden stars, gem cutouts)
  - **Quest 3 - "Final Boss Battle"** (7 min): Team game (dodgeball with soft foam balls, or a structured "capture the flag" using Roblox colors - red, blue, black, yellow)
  - **Extra time**: Award medals and celebrate winners

All children receive participation awards/medals. Team-based so no one feels left out. High energy finish to leave kids buzzing with excitement.
- **Theme Connection:** "Quests" are the foundation of Roblox gameplay. Kids are completing quests just like avatars do in-game.
- **Why It's Fun:** Final climactic challenge, multiple chances to win, physical excitement, teamwork, and everyone gets recognized.
- **Materials Needed:** Soft foam balls or dodgeballs, bean bags and targets, cones/rope for marked paths, gem/star cutouts, medals or ribbons for every participant, scoreboard (optional)
- **Setup Notes:** Pre-prepare all stations. Have clear instructions for each quest. Rotate kids through quickly to keep energy high. Ensure a climactic feeling with music (Roblox theme song playing via Bluetooth speaker) and dramatic announcing.

### 4:25 PM - 5:00 PM | BIRTHDAY CAKE, PRESENTS & GOODBYES (35 minutes)
- **Description:** Gather everyone for birthday cake/treats and singing. Nephew opens presents if desired or saves for home. Do a group photo with all kids wearing their avatar cards. Give out party favors (Robux tokens collected earlier, any small prizes won, a handmade certificate as "Roblox Player" badge). Thank everyone for coming and say special goodbyes. Stagger pickup so parents arrive gradually.
- **Theme Connection:** Certificate doubles as a memento and reinforce the achievement of "playing" in the Roblox world.
- **Why It's Fun:** Birthday celebration moment, recognition, and tangible memories/favors to take home.
- **Materials Needed:** Birthday cake/cupcakes, plates, forks, napkins, drinks, party favors (coins, prizes, certificates), birthday candles, camera for photos, goodie bags
- **Setup Notes:** Have cake set up and ready at a specific time. Print certificates beforehand with birthday child's name and date. Prepare goodie bags in advance so they're ready for quick handoff at pickup.

## BACKUP ACTIVITIES
*(Use these if activities run short, weather forces changes, or kids need alternatives)*

### BACKUP 1: "ROBLOX CHARADES" (10-15 minutes)
Act out popular Roblox games or actions for teammates to guess (e.g., someone acts out "Adopt Me," another acts out "Building a Boat," etc.). Fast-paced, no materials needed, and hilarious. Can be run as quick rounds if other activities finish early.

### BACKUP 2: "AVATAR DANCE BATTLE" (10-12 minutes)
Play upbeat music (Roblox soundtrack or current pop songs). Kids do freestyle dancing or teach each other dance moves. Could judge on creativity, silliness, or teamwork. Simple, fun, uses energy, and requires no setup. Great if weather forces indoor-adjacent activities.

### BACKUP 3: "BUILD YOUR OWN OBSTACLE COURSE" (15-20 minutes)
Give kids materials (chalk, cones, rope, available park equipment) and let THEM design a mini obstacle course for others to run through. Empowers creativity, uses up energy, extends building/engineering theme. Run relay races through kid-designed courses.

### BACKUP 4: "ROBLOX FREEZE DANCE" (8-10 minutes)
Play music and have kids dance freely. When music stops, they freeze in a Roblox-like pose. Judges pick funniest/best pose. Quick, energetic, works indoors or outdoors, minimal setup. Great for filling small time gaps or as a wind-down activity.

### BACKUP 5: "PIN THE TAIL ON THE ROBLOX AVATAR" (10 minutes)
A Roblox twist on the classic game. Create a large printed/drawn avatar poster, blindfold kids, and have them place a sticker part (hair, accessory, item) on the avatar. Works for older 8-year-olds with humor. Minimal setup, good for short breaks.

## NOTES FOR PARTY HOST

- **Energy Management:** The plan alternates high-energy (obstacle course, relays) with lower-energy activities (building, puzzles, rest). This prevents burnout while maintaining excitement.

- **Inclusivity:** All activities allow all children to participate regardless of athletic ability. Building, collecting, and creative challenges ensure less athletic kids shine too.

- **Outdoor Resilience:** Most activities can be adapted for minor weather:
  - Light rain: Move snack breaks under covered areas, shift activities closer to shelter
  - Extreme heat: Add extra water breaks, prioritize shaded areas
  - Very windy: Skip coin hunt, increase water breaks, move relays to protected areas

- **Time Flexibility:** Activities have built-in flex time. If something runs long, shorten a later activity slightly. If something ends early, launch a backup activity immediately.

- **Parent Communication:** Send parents the start/end time and pickup location. Mention bringing water bottles if desired. Let them know to wear athletic clothes.

- **Capture Memories:** Designate someone to take candid photos throughout. These are treasure for the birthday child and parents.

- **Personalization:** Include the birthday child's name in announcements, certificates, and challenges. Make them feel like the "main character" of the day.
