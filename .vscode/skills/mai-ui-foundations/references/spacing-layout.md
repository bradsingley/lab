# Spacing and Layout

- Anchor compositions to a simple grid; harmonize edges using multiples of 4px (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48).
- Prefer `gap` on flex and grid containers instead of stacking ad-hoc margins on children.
- Keep narrative sections roomy. Tighten spacing only for closely related controls, and stay consistent across symmetrical groups.
- Combine `padding` and `margin` in the same 4px scale to preserve rhythm between nested containers.
- When mixing MAI components with HTML wrappers, ensure the wrapper inherits spacing tokens so the seams disappear.
