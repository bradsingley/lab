# Design Guidance Index

Use this index to locate the right reference before drafting MAI UI plans or implementations.

## Foundational references
- [Design language](design-language.md): static/theme colors, elevation, layering, iconography, and material treatments.
- [Shape, size, and spacing](shape-spacing.md): corner ramps, smoothing rules, and spacing principles.
- [Typography](../../mai-ui-foundations/references/typography.md): font assets, semantic typography tokens, and styling guidance.
- [Motion system](motion.md): easing curves, duration ramps, and behavior mapping.
- [Voice and tone](voice-and-tone.md): writing principles, examples, and accessibility reminders.

## Implementation aids
- [Grid patterns](grid-patterns.md): canonical CSS snippets for Copilot, news, and shopping layouts.
- Component references: open the matching file under `../../mai-ui-components-and-patterns/references/` (e.g., `mai-button.md`, `mai-content-card.md`). Each file documents props, slots, and best practices for that component.

## Workflow
1. Identify which foundation you need (color, motion, typography, etc.) and open only that reference to preserve agent context.
2. Pair the relevant foundation with the component reference files while writing your implementation plan.
3. If guidance is missing, add a new focused reference rather than expanding this index.
