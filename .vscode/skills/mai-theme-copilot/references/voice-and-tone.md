# Voice and Tone

Our content voice pairs with the visual system to deliver the full experience.

## Principles
- **Warm & relaxed**: Natural, human language. Celebrate wins, stay approachable.
- **Crisp & clear**: Write for scanning first, reading second. Trim every unnecessary word.
- **Ready to help**: Anticipate needs, guide users with just-in-time information.

## Writing guidance
- Keep sentences short. Use present tense and active voice unless there’s a strong reason not to.
- Prefer second person (“you/your”) to maintain a conversational tone.
- Avoid jargon and buzzwords; trade them for concrete, human wording.
- Use descriptive headings as an outline—if the headings aren’t clear, the content won’t be either.
- Provide descriptive link text instead of “click here”.
- Skip directional terms (“above”, “left”); screen readers and localization can’t rely on them.
- Add accessible alternatives: alt text for imagery, meaningful `aria-label`s for icon-only controls.
- Use punctuation sparingly: periods for complete sentences, question marks for questions, exclamation points only when absolutely necessary.

## Examples
- Do: “You can’t undo this action.”
- Don’t: “This action can’t be undone.”
- Do: “Select the people you want to give permission to.”
- Don’t: “Alert me when a new Bluetooth device tries to connect to my computer.”

## Writing checklist
1. Simple structure and plain language.
2. Clear next steps and calls to action.
3. Conversational tone without slang.
4. Localizable phrasing (avoid idioms and directional cues).
5. Accessibility reviewed (links, alt text, ARIA annotations).
