# Single Page Web App Specifications

## Overview
This document outlines the technical requirements and constraints for building a single page web application focused on simplicity, performance, and accessibility.

## Core Technology Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **HTML**: Semantic HTML5 markup
- **CSS**: Modern CSS3 with custom properties (CSS variables)
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript only when necessary
- **No Build Process**: Direct file serving without compilation, bundling, or transpilation
- **No External Dependencies**: No frameworks, libraries, or CDN dependencies

### Platform-First Approach
- Leverage native browser APIs and web platform features
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Utilize CSS custom properties for theming
- Employ HTML form validation and semantic elements
- Prefer CSS solutions over JavaScript implementations
- Use `prefers-color-scheme` and `prefers-contrast` media queries

## Responsive Design Requirements

### Mobile-First Design
- Design and develop starting with mobile viewport (320px minimum)
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Touch-friendly interface elements (minimum 44px touch targets)
- Readable typography at all screen sizes

### Breakpoint Strategy
- Use CSS media queries for responsive behavior
- Fluid layouts that adapt gracefully between breakpoints
- Scalable font sizes using `clamp()`, `rem`, or `em` units
- Flexible images and media that scale appropriately

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize images for different screen densities
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP with fallbacks)
- Minimize layout shifts during loading
- Fast loading on mobile networks

## Accessibility & Theme Support

### Color Scheme Support
1. **Light Mode**: Default light theme with appropriate contrast ratios
2. **Dark Mode**: Dark theme triggered by `prefers-color-scheme: dark`
3. **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced contrast theme triggered by `prefers-contrast: high`

### Implementation Requirements
- Use CSS custom properties for consistent color management
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios for all themes
- Test with operating system theme preferences
- Provide manual theme switching as enhancement (optional)

### Accessibility Standards
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for all images
- Focus management and visible focus indicators
- Screen reader compatible
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color is not the only means of conveying information

## Technical Constraints

### File Structure
- Single HTML file or minimal file structure
- Inline CSS and JavaScript acceptable for simplicity
- External files should be minimal and locally hosted
- No package.json, webpack.config.js, or similar build files

### Browser Support
- Modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- CSS features with broad support (>95% browser compatibility)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers where practical

### Performance Targets
- Initial page load under 1 second on fast connections
- Usable within 3 seconds on slower mobile connections
- Minimal JavaScript execution time
- Small total page weight (< 500KB including images)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Clean, readable code with appropriate comments
- Consistent naming conventions
- Logical file organization
- Valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Testing Requirements
- Test across different devices and screen sizes
- Verify theme switching functionality
- Check accessibility with screen readers
- Validate performance on slower connections
- Cross-browser testing on major browsers

## Success Criteria
- Functions identically across all specified themes
- Responsive design works seamlessly from 320px to 1920px+ viewports
- Accessible to users with assistive technologies
- Loads quickly and performs well on mobile devices
- Code is maintainable and follows web standards
- No JavaScript errors or CSS warnings in browser developer tools
