Despite its ubiquity—and perhaps because of its lack of subtlety—for a hundred years Cooper continues to draw the faithful. It’s even come to define an entire typographic genre and recently starred in its own \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/21294395/cooper-black-pop-culture\" target=\"blank\"\u003edocumentary\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cp\u003eCooper Nouveau is Dave West’s imaginative contribution to the Cooper oeuvre. Drawn in 1966, Nouveau refreshes Oswald Cooper’s original italic with an energetic pitch, simplified contours, and a plump friendly figure. Uniform strokes and generous curves push the font’s playful personality and springy silhouette even further. A selection of swashed characters and ligatures offers options for lively logos and strong captions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Cooper Nouveau looks laid-back and easy-going, it\u0026#8217;s more than capable of pulling it’s own typographic weight. Put it to work where \u003cem\u003erelaxed\u003c/em\u003e needs to project \u003cem\u003econfident\u003c/em\u003e. Set Nouveau large for eye-magnet posters, packaging, and advertisements. Maximize its youthful energy for kids’ themes, craft action, and apparel bounce. Or set it alongside a master like Benguiat \u003ca href=\"https://houseind.com/hi/buffalo\"\u003e(Buffalo)\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://houseind.com/hi/chalet\"\u003eChalet\u003c/a\u003e to show how Cooper Nouveau can communicate on paper and screens with an inherent ability to speak the language of style in many tongues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut like any cult icon: beware! Cooper has a way of setting the needle, and Nouveau just may become your go-to design fix. \u003ca href=\"https://hello.houseind.com/journals/cooper-nouveau/\" target=\"blank\"\u003eLearn More\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eCOOPER\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eNOUVEAU\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eCREDITS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypeface Design: Dave West\u003cbr /\u003e\nDigitization: Dave Foster\u003cbr /\u003e\nTypeface Direction: Ben Kiel, with Ken Barber\u003c/p\u003e","packages":[]};gon.translations={"licenseDescription":{"desktop":{"heading":"Desktop","content":"This license is for traditional \u0026ldquo;desktop\u0026rdquo; use.

Drawn in 1966, Nouveau refreshes Oswald Cooper’s original italic with an energetic pitch, simplified contours, and a plump friendly figure.
